# Ethereum Dapp using Truffle and web3
This app was built following a [tutorial on Dapp University](https://www.dappuniversity.com/articles/the-ultimate-ethereum-dapp-tutorial).

The project leverages the Truffle framework and was initialised by unboxing their [Pet Shop box](https://trufflesuite.com/boxes/pet-shop/).

## Running the app

Ensure you have node, npm, truffle and web3 installed globally.

Install the MetaMask extension in your browser.

Spin up a Ganache quick start server locally.

From a terminal run `npm run dev` and the application will be running on http://localhost:3000/.
